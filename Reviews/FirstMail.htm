Hi Mike,&nbsp;<br>
read your very impressive CD list.<br>
<br>
Before going on trades I want to introduce myself a bit.<br>
I am from the Netherlands and a Yes fan from 1974, just missed the release of Relayer.<br>
I'm now 38 years and teach Computer Science.<br>
I've got some friends who are also really into Yes, but I am<br>
the big fan, the other are more into Genesis and Renaissance.<br>
My other interest into music is Prokofiev. If you don't know<br>
him and we'll trade some I will record some stuff of him.<br>
<br>
Favorite album is TFTO and Favorite Tours are 74 upto 77.<br>
In that time I also collected the now rare LPs. I've seen you've got<br>
many of them like Sorcerer's Apprentice, In the Round and Yesshows 77!<br>
I saw them first in 1977 and have a vare bad (but also rare) performance<br>
of 24/11/77.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I really like what Yes is doing nowadays (except OYE) and the<br>
concerts were GREAT. Read my review on the 9th march in Utrecht, The Netherlands on NFTE.<br>
<br>
I've got a CD recorder over 3 years and made a lot of recordings<br>
(approx. 700).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I hope to trade with you but maybe you can tell something about yourself as well, if you want!<br>
<br>
OK, I'll get into the main list. As I'm not such a trader I must make it now,<br>
but I think I will save it!<br>

<br>
Rest:<br>
  I've also got the common Japanese stuff of Moraz (I,II,III,FM1,FM2,LIP)<br>
  plus Refugee, plus All to bring you morning complete ( THAT's a great album),<br>
  Buggles - Adventures+Bonus Tracks.<br>
  Some Genesis Boots (about 10, but can get more from my friends)&nbsp;<br>
  plus AN AWFUL LOT of Renaissance<br>
<br>
As you can see, I think you've got the most of it, but I think we could<br>
do some interesting trades on the rest.<br>
<br>
Please tell me if you're interested and if, how many items, you think we&nbsp;<br>
should do (the money can't be the burden as CDR's now cost about 1.5$ here!<br>
when I first bought my recorder they were about 10$)!<br>
<br>
Bye, Ruud <br>
