<p>Yesterday was a disaster - Not theirs fault though!<br>
Too keep it short: after 30 minutes I found out I had lost my carkeys...<br>
Searched everywhere, nothing to be found. So I just sat out the rest of show,
did quite enjoy, but it all<br>
flashed around like a movie. After the show I told my friend I lost my keys and
then<br>
the biggest &quot;thing&quot; happened: He told he had them! I gave them to him
before the show!!!<br>
O my God, so I really missed show due to a silly thing.....<br>
Well tonight, it will be a good night!<br>
<br>
BTW: We taped but not on a too good location. I allready have a name for the
discs: Keys To Homeworld :}<br>
