<p>Yes In Holland

Last night Yes was in Holland, again.
Before proceeding, here's a plea to the group:
Dear Yes, I know we were spoiled in 2001 with two fantastic concerts in Amsterdam,
by many considered as THE highlight in your career. 
But please, please next time when you come to Holland,
1. please play the same set as the night before
2. please play in a venue not ment for animals.

Details? 
As you may remember Yes played Ahoy last year, a terrible place with bad acoustics
and large parts with only standing places. They played a song they didn't play before
that tour "I've seen all good people".

This time it was ten times worse. They played a festival, as headliners. In comparison
to the previous night in Dusseldorf there were no sculptures, no robokicks and the setlist
was shortened to 90 minutes. 
But that wasn't the worst, no the venue where this took place was in the middle of nowhere 
and the place was covered with straws and (cow)-shit. (Really!!)
I was at front but exactly behind me there were twenty people around me, who sang
the full(that is the 2nd part) of the show in my ears, trembled the floor and were dancing against my back. Well, well what a nice way to listen to Yes. Come on guys, can't you do ONE decent show in 
Holland, in a proper venue.

To make things worse they changed the setlist (auch, here we go again)...Not only was it shortened but we got Owner Of A lonely Heart in electric version (without any of the keyboard effects, or 
solos, which were handled by Wakeman in a "simple" way on the Piano...) My god and after that Rhythm Of Love... What a setlist. The rest after MindDrive was one big-hit-bazooka to please 
the festival audience. Thank you for five per cent... </p>
