<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>this is my review on Tuesdays Rotterdam Show.</p>
<p>I was pretty cinical on how this one might proceed, because I went to Ahoy
Rotterdam a few times. This venues is pretty large, well for Dutchmen that is :}</p>
<p>This time we had &quot;best seats&quot;, which turned to be about 100 meters
from the Podium!!! When we arrived I was shocked to see that many people were
queued up, turned out that most of the venue would be filled standing places! So
at 100 meters with a lot of people ahead of us my friend said he'd join the
standing crowd and oh sigh.. why not join.</p>
<p>We were able to queue in pretty quick (no will not tell the details) and
because of my firm begging we immediately went into the main place. Guess what,
it was STILL empty, so we managed to get at the second row !! Wow, that's about
5 meters from our heroes!!</p>
<p>So this night it would turn out to be a complete differnt watching to what I
am used to. It has its drawbacks in the standing crowd, (disadvantage:
standing(!), little space, waving people) but taken that in account and the fact
we were sooo near I really was able to enjoy the show very much. They played
better than in Brussels and they were loving the amazed crowd.It's such a treat
to see the guys enjoying themselves, most notably Rick Wakeman who's singing
along ALL the time. Something I was asking myself: When _I_ shead into tears
during AYAI or Awaken (but also during South Side!) do these guys feel the same?
Boy they have an amazing job then!</p>
<p>Well what more to say, it was all pretty perfect, can't tell about the sound
IN the venue, but at the front it was darn good. The Magnification songs get
tougher for me every time I hear them, but after that it was one highlight after
the other.</p>
<p>Awaken wasn't as good as in Brussel, the magicjust wan't there as much. Too
bad.</p>
<p>The real interesting part started at the encores.... Jon was very please to
tell us they were going to play a &quot;new song&quot; and when I saw Ron
(guitar-tech) pickup an acoustic, I knew it, &quot;I've seen all good
people&quot;. Well Jon, we're not actually thrilled to hear THAT song but for
the feast which was going on it was pretty nice. After that, Roundabout, nice
but not shocking. Than something happened: The band was finished but the crowd
was ABSOLUTELY wild, they really didn't want them to leave. But offcourse they
did, but the crowd kept screaming, screamin for more. I've never heard something
like this. The light stayed dimmed, no music started, but what a noise it was,
more, more, more.... Then,after a minute the lights went on and you be glad you
weren't there, because there was boo-ing which was VERY loud as well.</p>
<p>Still everyone was puzzled, why didn't they get back again, it was such a
plea!! Well at the end the music started and we gave up. Really, you would have
expected to come back, but it didn't happen. After the show was over we
discussed on why, but I remember they were playing hannover the next day (a very
long ride from Rotterdam) so that explained a bit.</p>
<p>It was a magical night and it really made my Circle round. After almost 25
years I saw the guys there were it all started. Not at 100 meters and missing
Awaken, but at 5 meters :}</p>
<p>A bit demystifying though...</p>
<p>That's it folks! O recording succeeded :}</p>
