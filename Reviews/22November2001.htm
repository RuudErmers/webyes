  <font face="Arial" size="2">We hit the TRIPLE Jackpot!</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Well, you may allready have heard what happened
  last night.<br>
  Yes played maybe its best concert ever.<br>
  Tjee after Tuesday and Wednesday I could not have believed they could do any
  better.<br>
  But this show was simply superiour to the night before.<br>
  Reason: Well Steve Howe was in a very good mood and that shows!</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">But again, let's start at the beginning.<br>
  AS we assumed the show would be recorded and we were all invited to setup the
  audience<br>
  levels by screaming as loud as we could (we didn't).<br>
  The show started exactly on time, meaning this time many people came in late,
  tjeee :}<br>
  When Steve Howe hit the stage he was allready smiling, NEVER seen him like
  this!<br>
  They went into a furious CTTE and it was time to give all a good glance. Jon
  was wearing a green<br>
  shirt, Chris in his same outfit, and the orchestra was wearing a light purple
  blouse over the<br>
  white shirts. It all looked magnificent and you could see they were all extra
  motivated for the<br>
  video shooting. The camera's didn't bother too much, allthough I can't believe
  they can have<br>
  shot too good things as they were moving the whole of the time.<br>
  Anyway, the magic was immediately there, floating and floating. The orchestra
  was LOUD, as it<br>
  is supposed to be! I could hear great harp playing the whole time - Angelic :}<br>
  Tom Brislin got his keyboard solo again PERFECT, man that's one of the
  highlights of this tour.<br>
  I won't go into LDR and Don't Go, that's just some nice things coming around
  to relax to.<br>
  Jon was also in a very good mood, and man, the audiance was so enthousiastic!<br>
  The Amsterdam Tour Song was pretty funny, but not as nice as the night before
  I thought.<br>
  Were they going to play Gates? Offcourse they would, but you'd never know (O
  come on Ruud, you<br>
  didn't doubt it for a minute!). Anyway &quot;In the Presence Of&quot; was
  played magnificantly, the orchestra<br>
  really good.<br>
  Ok, there was Gates!! Started a bit messy, but soon it was perfect playing
  from all. This was<br>
  great. Even better than the day before, Chris was better I think, and the mix
  with the orchestra as<br>
  well. I even thought the orchestra was too loud in some parts, but hey, we're
  talking perfectionism<br>
  here!! Gates went by as a flow, does this track times 22 minutes? Can't
  believe it, felt like 5<br>
  at most!! Man, I hope they'll play it for you in England because it's so good.<br>
  Jon told us it was the last night for the Orchestra, and &quot;they had to get
  a job&quot; afterwards,<br>
  which was yelled at by the audience and he excused himself by saying that they
  didn't understand what he<br>
  was saying anyway. Hmmm, I am curious if they will put that on the DVD....</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Halfway Gates the curtain drops (maybe I should
  not spoil this in case you haven't seen it, skip the next line)<br>
  and then the beautiful blue night sky appears. O, it's such perfectly done
  all, amazing.<br>
  After Gates all left except Steve with his capable hands, who played the
  Concerto in D and Mood for A day.<br>
  Surprisingly as they played two others the two days before and I would have
  bet my cards on that.<br>
  But he, I looove the Concerto in D, and he played it magnificently. He was
  very pleased all the way,<br>
  but after playing his soloset, we could actually see his teeth!!</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">So, we were ready for the second part of the show.
  Starship Trooper.... You know what I think of it,<br>
  so let's concentrate on the second part. I talked to some who thought Chris
  was overdoing this. They<br>
  are absolutely right, but it is so great to watch. Man, I can't wait for that
  DVD!! It doesn't have much<br>
  to do with the original Wurm but it's shear fun. They audience went wild after
  this.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Next Magnification - tjee have seen this now for
  three times allready (Yes aMericans this time you might be<br>
  a bit healous at us, but we will have our share of jealousy when they again
  play the states {: ).<br>
  Last night was sooo much better than the other two nights. It fitted exactly,
  the orchestra, the band.<br>
  It's a pretty hard thing to play, I am convinced but last night - Perfect!
  It's amazing how this can<br>
  be so different on two occasions.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">On to AYAI, mjam, mjam, still getting many many
  goosebumps there. It's so nice to see Jon doing this.<br>
  I think he's really into that one, even after a zillion of years. There's
  nothing &quot;fake&quot; on his<br>
  waving stuff! It will look great on the Video.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">He, the Audience was pretty quiet BTW, so all who
  were sitting near to me (4th row, center) THANKS!</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">On to Ritual... that one get's more impressive
  every night you see it. What a killer! Everyone in<br>
  the audience loved it. It was again played so perfectly, so intense. Again
  that Orchestra during the<br>
  drumsolo I love it soo much!! And than Steve with that perfect ending, so, so
  great.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">OK, this time I will not continue with the verdict
  but with the show!! The audience got crazy and<br>
  everyone was sooo happy. I hope I am not on the DVD in that part, because I
  completely went nuts.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Showtime - starting with I've seen All Good
  People. Woohoo, love that track, especially the first part.<br>
  But this time during the second&nbsp; it was such a party, rave on!</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">After that, it was over, but we knew to expect
  Owner as an encore.<br>
  And YES, they played it !!! Oh oh, they did it good, and yes, Steve actually
  plays it and was not bored.<br>
  Allthough you can see he thinks it's not serious, he made the best of it. And
  than the Trevor Rabin<br>
  Solo !!!! Played by Tom ha ha. No Steve is not going to do that one! But
  afterwards he played his solo in it,<br>
  very nice.<br>
  The crowd went mad again! And than Roundabout, still! And a very nice surprise
  the whole orchestra joined<br>
  them onstage, waving and dancing. Ehh how should I put this polite... All
  these young girls, very beautiful,<br>
  dancing behind the band. I believe I payed more attention to them as to the
  band. AND SO DID CHRIS !!<br>
  Wow, must be nice to be over fifty doing this. I should never have givin up
  playing in a band ha!<br>
  No, it was one wild party and everybody loved it! After that, it was over.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">Man, this WAS the best Yesshow ever, and also one
  of the longest. We did some aftertalk (hi Ernst, Albert)<br>
  and than had a safe (but very long) journey home.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Arial" size="2">O, this will be so perfect when it will be on DVD,
  allthough our recording was ALSO perfect.<br>
  Release it quick, boys!</font>
