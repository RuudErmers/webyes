<P><font size="2">OK, I can be pretty short on this one. I just don't have the
time to watch these videos. I have seen most official release two or three
times. I usually peek into VCDs I receive at the best moments and sometimes
watch them full. But that's it! I will gladly trade these with you but please
don't expect a quality judgement. I am looking for ANY VCDs not mentioned,
especially those to upgrade from my Video collection so I can put it on the
ceiling!</font></P>
<P><font size="2">And before you tell me, I'll tell you: This list is pretty
much a mess, but it's a start!</font></P>
