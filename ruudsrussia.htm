<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Ruud's Russia CD</b></font></p>
<p><b>Allthough I trade mainly Yes I do have other musical interests. Now I am
not going to bother you with other progrock or electronic music, but one thing
which is closely related to prog is Russian classical music of the last century.
You'll all know the Firebird finale by Strawinsky and probably know one or two
pieces by Prokofiev (Romeo and Julliet, The Enemy God).</b></p>
<p><b>Well, I am fully into that, in fact, apart from one or two works I have
the complete works by Prokofiev (on about 80 CDs!). I've created a disc with
some highlights of these, emphasizing on Prokofiev and Russian ballet music.</b></p>
<p><b>I sometimes include this disc in my trades, and if you want to have one as
well, just let me know, I'll add it for free! But please let me know what you
think of it.</b></p>
<p><b>This is the content of this CD:</b></p>
<p><font size="5"><b>1. Prokofiev</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>The first part of the cd is devoted to Prokofiev. I've not
necessarily included the best tracks, but have tried to go a bit across his
works. I want to warn you that these pieces are absolutely not light weighted.
You should really play them more than one time. Remember that I am a prog lover
like you, so there should be something in it!</b></font></p>
<p><b>1. Scythian Suite (6.29)</b></p>
<p><b>The scythian suite is one of the early ballets Prokofiev wrote. It's from
about the same date as Stravinsky's &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;, which succeeded
the Firebird. The theme I have chosen starts very heavily but continues
melodicly - this is a trademark of Prokofiev.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><br>
2.      On Guard For Peace Opening (8.28)</b></p>
<p><b>Talking about heavy stuff! This is it. Prokofiev wrote some very nice
choral works, very bombastic with orchestras and choirs. Ivan the terrible is a
good example. This work is also very nice and you will notice that in 8 minutes
there's a lot that can be done!</b></p>
<p><b>3. Violin Concerto. 1 (7.21)</b></p>
<p><b>This is an absolutely stunning piece. However it took me years to find
this out. Especially the violin is a bit hard to get used to, but if you do, you
will discover the real beauty of this piece. If it is too hard for you, you
might like to try out the third piano concerto, which is as beautiful as this.
Both recommended!</b></p>
<p><b><br>
4. Symphony 7, Vivace (8.40)</b></p>
<p><b>OK, if you thought the previous tracks were too hard for you try this one.
Prokofiev wrote seven symphonies and this is his last one at the peek of his
career. Very Russian, yet extremely melodic. What a fine tune this is, it
exactly represents Prokofiev stands for.</b></p>
<p><font size="5"><b>2. Russian Ballet music</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>The second part of the cd is devoted to Russian ballet
music. It's more light hearted than the first part, yet there's musically very
much to be discovered. Ballet music, mostly played at the Bolshoi theater, is
one of the cultural exports of Russia and I would love to see the Bolshoi
someday. I've acquired a lot of music written for ballets, in the 20th century,
and here are some highlights. You will notice that the quality of some pieces
isn't perfect, this is correct, as some recordings are quite old (1960 - 1970)
and the 10th track even is from LP!</b></font></p>
<p><b><font size="3">This part starts off with five melodic pieces by Gliere,
Glazunov, Schostakowitsch,</font>Khachaturian and Tchaikovsky<font size="3"> .
It gives you an idea how balletlike this music is.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>After that two absolute highlights in music&nbsp; are
presented. Karayev's &quot;Path of Thunder&quot; is the most stunning Adagio I
know. If you don't like this one, there's something wrong with your ears! If
anyone gets across a full performance of this ballet let me know (It's about 2
hours).&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Allthough Karayev's piece is my favorite, the following
&quot;Humpbacked horse&quot;, by Shschedrin is my favorite ballet (yes, I like
it more than any of Prokofiev's). You will notice the resemblance with
Stravinsky's Firebird, but hey, this ballet lasts for 100 minutes of very fine
music. Recommended!</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><b>The CD finishes off with the finale of the Firebird. This
is a chance for you to listen to some well-known music. It also gives you the
chance to think on what the rest is like. You may like the Firebird more than
the rest, but I guarantee you, if you give it a chance, the rest is of equal
fine quality!</b></font></p>
<p><b>5.&nbsp; Gliere - A Merry Dance (2.59)<br>
6.&nbsp; Glazunov  - Spring (5.20)<br>
7.&nbsp; Schostakovitsch - Golden Age - Introduction (3.36)<br>
8.&nbsp; Khachaturian - Gayanah (4.12)<br>
9.&nbsp; Tchaikovsky - Arabian Dance (3.10)<br>
10. Karayev  - Path of Thunder (7.09)<br>
11. <font size="3">Shschedrin </font> - Humpbacked Horse (7.31)<br>
12. Strawinsky - Firebird (7.04)</b></p>
<p><b>Some final remarks: </b></p>
<p><b>I sometimes put this disc on the artwork disc, and sometimes have to leave
off the last track(s) to fit the images.</b></p>
